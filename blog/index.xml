      <description>The motivation behind building TiSpark was to enable real-time analytics on TiDB without the delay and challenges of ETL. Extract, transform, and load (ETL)&amp;ndash;a process to extract data from operational databases, transform that data, then load it into a database designed to supporting analytics&amp;ndash;has been one of the most complex, tedious, error-prone, and therefore disliked tasks for many data engineers. However, it was a necessary evil to make data useful, because there hasn&#39;t been good solutions on the market to render ETL obsolete&amp;ndash;until now.</description>

      <description>As an open-source distributed scalable HTAP database, TiDB uses the Raft Consensus Algorithm in its distributed transactional key-value storage engine, TiKV, to ensure data consistency, auto-failover, and fault tolerance. TiDB has thus far been used by more than 200 companies in their production environments in a wide range of industries, from e-commerce and food delivery, to fintech, media, gaming, and travel.</description>

      <description>As an open source distributed NewSQL Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database, TiDB contains the most important asset of our customers&amp;ndash;their data. One of the fundamental and foremost requirements of our system is to be fault-tolerant. But how do you ensure fault tolerance in a distributed database? This article covers the top fault injection tools and techniques in Chaos Engineering, as well as how to execute Chaos practices in TiDB.</description>

      <title>How to do Performance Tuning on TiDB, A Distributed NewSQL Database</title>
      <link>https://pingcap.com/blog/performance_tuning_on_a_distributed_newsql_database/</link>

      <guid>https://pingcap.com/blog/performance_tuning_on_a_distributed_newsql_database/</guid>
      <description>Doing performance tuning on distributed systems is no joking matter. It&#39;s much more complicated than on a single node server, and bottlenecks can pop up anywhere, from system resources in a single node or subcomponent, to cooperation between nodes, to even network bandwidth. Performance tuning is a practice that aims to find these bottlenecks and address them, in order to reveal more bottlenecks and address them as well, until the system reaches an optimal performance level. In this article, I will share some best practices on how to tune &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; operations in TiDB to achieve maximum performance.</description>

      <description>At re:Invent 2017, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced Amazon Time Sync Service which is a highly accurate and reliable time reference that is natively accessible from Amazon EC2 instances. It is much like the Google TrueTime which was published in 2012. Why do Google and AWS both want to make efforts to provide global time service? Is there any inspiration for building distributed database? This topic is important to think about.</description>

      <title>A TiKV Source Code Walkthrough – Raft Optimization</title>

      <description>Paxos or Raft is frequently used to ensure data consistency in the distributed computing area. But Paxos is known for its complexity and is rather difficult to understand while Raft is very simple. Therefore, a lot of emerging databases tend to use Raft as the consensus algorithm at its bottom layer. TiKV is no exception.</description>

      <guid>https://pingcap.com/blog/2016-12-07-Subquery-Optimization-in-TiDB/</guid>
      <description>Subquery optimization, especially rewriting the correlated subquery, is a very difficult part in SQL query optimization. To be compatible with MySQL, TiDB enables users to write subqueries anywhere they want. For those subqueries that are not correlated, which are also called uncorrelated subqueries, TiDB evaluates in advance; for those correlated subqueries, TiDB removes the correlations as much as possible. For example, TiDB can rewrite a correlated subquery to &lt;code&gt;SemiJoin&lt;/code&gt;. This article is focused on introducing the correlated subquery optimization methods in TiDB.</description>
